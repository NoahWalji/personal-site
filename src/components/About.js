            <p>Hi There! My name is Noah Walji and I am a 4th year student at Wilfrid Laurier University, majoring in a double degree of Computer Science (BSc) and Buisness Administration (BBA). 
            I am a passionate full stack developer always looking to expand and challenge my current skills. I love brainstorming, planning and building web applications to solve problems I face on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding away, you can probably catch me watching a game of hockey. I also love to swim, and it's usually the one thing I love to do to take my mind off work!</p>
